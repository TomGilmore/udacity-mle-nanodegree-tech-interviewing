##Project OverviewFor this project, students will answer 5 technical interview questions and get feedback from a qualified reviewer.##Why This Project?Having the knowledge to get through technical interviews is certainly helpful, but it won’t mean very much if you can’t clearly demonstrate this knowledge. This project will be assessed for correctness, but also criteria a real interviewer would look for, like clear and clean code, an understanding of efficiency, good communication, et cetera.##What Will I Learn?You will learn where your interviewing weaknesses lie. Graders have been instructed to be tough, so you cannot pass unless your answers are good enough that a real interviewer would be impressed.##How Do I Complete this Project?* Make sure you have some prior knowledge of technical interviewing or have gone through the Technical Interviewing course.* For each question, create a solution in Javascript (ECMASCRIPT 5). All solutions should be functions named as “question1”, “question2”, et cetera. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed. Code solutions must be in a file called "solutions.js".* In the same .js file, include at least 3 test cases for each solution. For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console, like `console.log(question1())`. On the next line, comment out the output you expect to see from that function call. At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, et cetera.* Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text file (called "explanations.txt"). Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.* Compress your one Javascript and one text file into a .zip, and submit on the website.##Questions####Question 1Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine whether some anagram of `t` is a substring of `s`. For example: if `s = "udacity";` and `t = "ad";`, then the function returns `true`. Your function call should look like: `question1(s, t)`, and return a boolean `true` or `false`.####Question 2Given a string `a`, find the longest palindromic substring contained in `a`. Your function call should look like `question2(a)`, and return a string.####Question 3Given an undirected graph `G`, find the minimum spanning tree within `G`. A minimum spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph with the smallest possible total weight of edges. Your function should take in and return an adjacency list structured like this:```Javascript{'A': [['B', 2]], 'B': [['A', 2], ['C', 5]], 'C': [['B', 5]]}```Vertices are represented as unique strings. The function call should be `question3(G)`####Question 4Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree. The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function call should look like `question4(T, r, n1, n2)`, where `T` is the tree represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer stored in that node and a `1` represents a child node vs. `0` which represents not-a-child-node, `r` is a non-negative integer representing the root, and `n1` and `n2` are non-negative integers representing the two nodes in no particular order. For example, one test case might be```Javascriptquestion4([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],            [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],           3,          1,          4)```and the answer would be `3`.####Question 5 Find the element in a singly linked list that's m elements from the end. For example, if a linked list has 5 elements, the 3rd element from the end is the 3rd element. The function definition should look like `question5(ll, m)`, where `ll` is the first node of a linked list and `m` is the "mth number from the end". You should copy/paste the `Node` class below to use as a representation of a node in the linked list. Return the value of the node at that position.```Javascriptvar Node = function(data) {  this.data = data;  this.next = null;};``` ##EvaluationYour project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
